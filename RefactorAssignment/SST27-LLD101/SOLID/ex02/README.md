# Exercise ex02

#1. This is a little hard question for me, cz i cant really getting the frame things like what can be change in the future in this case...not a very common type...but i am able to predict some things like SRP is not following in the player class, cz by comments alone we can able to get that one class is doing more than 1 task so its not a good design...
#2. OCP is also not following cz we cant extend the player to support different media types...
#3. Not sure about LSP and ISP cz no inheritence was being used...
#4. The first thing i able to see violating is DSP, cz player directly depends on creating object of concrete class rather than abstraction.
